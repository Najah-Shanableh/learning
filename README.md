# Learning

@nsmader just added some materials on causality:

* A great presentation constructed by Matt Gee for communicating issues around establishing--and considering challenges to--causality
* An (infamous) 2005 paper on theoretical concerns by Jim Heckman. Very opinionated about how economists part company in establishing causality as compared to statisticians and full of changes in notation, but ultimately very readable
* Will follow soon with slides from my learning lunch talk

## Documentation

Documentation is paramount, and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
help keeps documentation maintainable.
"Markdown" is just a popular markup language, like "MediaWiki markup" (used on Wikipedia)
or "reStructured text" (often used in Python docstring documentation).

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, compared to `HTML`.
It's less flexibile, but more concise.
GitHub loves Markdown and automatically renders any `*.md` documents into pretty HTML
for pleasant online viewing.

Here are some (GitHub Flavored) Markdown (GFM) cheatsheets:
