NSM-- just added some materials on causality:
* A great presentation constructed by Matt Gee for communicating issues around establishing--and considering challenges to--causality
* An (infamous) 2005 paper on theoretical concerns by Jim Heckman. Very opinionated about how economists part company in establishing causality as compared to statisticians and full of changes in notation, but ultimately very readable
* Will follow soon with slides from my learning lunch talk
