**Setup**

Must first install _sklearn_. Recommend installing via [ScipySuperpack](http://fonnesbeck.github.io/ScipySuperpack/).

**Description**

Clean up input data (pre-processing), _scikit.preprocessing_

- normalize data
- Fill in missing values 
- outlier detection
- dimensionality reduction
- Manifold learning

[Comparison of Classifiers](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/auto_examples/plot_classifier_comparison.html), images of decision boundaries generated by each one.
	
Many algorithms already implemented.

- PCA: Principal Component Analysis
- Separate Sound sources
- Manifold learning
- MultiLabel - e.g. Multiple data points -- say (Lat, Lng) -- for every item. Could be discrete or continuous.
- svm stuff is very fast in SciKit -- drops into c for many algorithms. 

Matplotlib integration. (also allows LaTeX on your plots)

Can do multiple classification

Documentation is great

Scales better than weka

**Caveats**

If loading in big amount of data, don't use default loading techniques... slow, will crash, etc.

Not so good at:
	- graphical models
	- natural language processing (have to pre-process outside)
	- ...however, has a pipeline that you can plug-in at any point

Many of these algorithms are computer memory bound; need all data in memory. Some ways around this:
	- Use a database, use an algorithm that works out of a database
	- Map-reduce, distributed approach

MultiCore
	- Python runs in one process so will only use 1 core, by default
	- If you use GridSearch, it will run across multiple processes, so can work on several cores.
